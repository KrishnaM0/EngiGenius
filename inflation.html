    Inflation is the term that frequently appears in the news headline and economic reports. 
    Which actually refers to increasing prices of goods and services over time. But when 
    inflation occurs, the purchasing power of money decreases. Which means you need to spend 
    more money for buying same products.

</p>
<h2>
    What causes Inflation?

</h2>
<p>
    There are several factors that can lead to inflation. Some of them are: -

</p>
<h3>
    •	Demand-Pull Inflation

</h3>
<p>
    This can happen when, the demand for goods and services surpasses the actual supply. 
    For example, if a new smartphone is released and demand for buying that smartphone gets higher. 
    Where, everyone wants to buy that smartphone but, there are only limited number of smartphones 
    available in market. Then, the cost of that smartphone will increase.

</p>
<h3>
    •	Cost-Pull Inflation

</h3>
<p>
    This occurs when the cost of production increases in any industry. Then, producers can 
    increase the prices of their products or services for maintaining their profit margins. 
    For example, when the prices of raw material required for production or wages of workers increases 
    then businesses will charge more amount for delivering their products or services.

</p>
<h3>
    •	Built-in Inflation

</h3>
<p>
    When workers in industries start demanding for higher payments/salaries 
    for keep up with their rising living costs. Then, for fulfilling their demands 
    industries increases the cost of their services or products for their customers. 
    So, they can manage their expenses too. It is also called as wage-price inflation.

</p>
<h2>
    Effects of Inflation

</h2>
<h3>
    •	Purchasing power

</h3>
<p>
    Due to inflation the prices of goods and services get increased and value of money falls down. 
    Which means the consumers can buy less with the same amount of money. 
    This is how inflation hits purchasing power.

</p>
<h3>
    •	Savings and Investments

</h3>
<p>
    Inflation can affect savings of people's when the interest rate given on saving accounts 
    gets lesser than inflation rates then, the value of their money will ultimately reduce. 
    Whereas, investments like stocks and real estate may offer returns that outpace inflation.

</p>
<h3>
    •	Interest Rates

</h3>
<p>
    The central banks can control inflation by providing interest rates higher than inflation rates. 
    Higher interest rates can reduce inflation but it slows down the economic growth.

</p>
<h2>
    Managing Inflation

</h2>
<h3>
    •	Fiscal Policy

</h3>
<p>
    Governments can reduce the inflation through their taxation policy and spendings. 
    Where reducing public spending or increasing taxes can help to lower inflation

</p>
<h3>
    •	Supply-Side Policies

</h3>
<p>
    Improving the production, productivity and by increasing the supply of goods and services can help to 
    control inflation. And, this can include measures like investing in education, technology and 
    infrastructure.

</p>
<h3>
    •	Monetary Policy

</h3>
<p>
    Central banks have the power to control money supply and interest rates which can influence inflation. 
    And, by increasing the interest rates they can reduce inflation and can cool down the overheating 
    economy.

</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion

</h2>
<p>
    The inflation can directly affect the economy and understanding the causes of inflation, 
    planning and executing better solutions for avoiding inflation by taking better financial decisions 
    because crucial. Whether you are investing, saving or planning your budget. Staying informed about
